    "For a node x, let $\\Gamma(x)$ denote the set of neighbors of $x$. In common sense, two nodes, $x$ and $y$, are more likely to have a link if they have many common neighbors. The simplest measure of this neighborhood overlap is the directed count, namely\n",
    "$$s_{xy}^{CN} = |\\Gamma(x) \\cap \\Gamma(y)|,$$\n",
    "where $|Q|$ is the cardinality of the set $Q$. It is obvious that $s_{xy} = (A^2)_{xy}$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix: $A_{xy} = 1$ if $x$ and $y$ are directly connected and $A_{xy} = 0$ otherwise. Note that, $(A^2)_{xy}$ is also the number of different paths with length 2 connecting $x$ and $y$. Newman [40] used this quantity in the study of collaboration networks, showing a positive correlation between the number of common neighbors and the probability that two scientists will collaborate in the future. Kossinets and Watts [14] analyzed a large-scale social network, suggesting that two students having many mutual friends are very probable to be friends in future. The following six indices are also based on the number of common neighbors, yet with different normalization methods."

The node $x$ can send some resource to $y$, with their common neighbors playing the role of transmitters. In the simplest case, we assume that each transmitter has a unit of resource, and will equally distribute it to all its neighbors. The similarity between $x$ and $y$ can be defined as the amount of resource $y$ received from $x$, which is\n",

    "Clearly,this measure is symmetric,namely $s_{xy} = s_{yx}$.Note that, although resulting from different motivations, the AA index and RA index have very similar form. Indeed, they both depress the contribution of the high-degree common neighbors. AA index takes the form $(log k )^{−1}$ while RA index takes the form $k^{−1}$. The difference is insignificant when the degree, $k_z$, is small, while it is considerable when $k_z$ is large. In other words, RA index punishes the high-degree common neighbors more heavily than AA."

And if $x$ and $y$ are not directly connected (this is the case we are interested in), $(A^3)_{xy}$ is equal to the number of different paths with length 3 connecting $x$ and $y$. This index can be extended to account for higher-order paths, as\n",

Especially, when $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, $S^{LP(n)}$ will be equivalent to the Katz index that takes into account all paths in the network. The computational complexity of this index in an uncorrelated network is $\\mathbb{O}(N⟨k⟩^n)$, which grows fast with the increasing of n and will exceed the complexity for calculating the Katz index (approximate to $\\mathbb{O}(N^3)$) for large $n$. Experimental results show that the optimal $n$ is positively correlated with the average shortest distance of the network."
